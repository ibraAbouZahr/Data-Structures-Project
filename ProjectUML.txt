The Shop class represents an individual shop, containing a shop ID, shop name, and a linked list of products.

The ProductLinkedList class represents a linked list of products in a shop.

The ProductNode class represents a node in the linked list of products, containing a reference to a product and the next node.

The Product class represents an individual product, containing a product ID, product name, and price.

The CustomerQueue class represents a queue of customers.

The CustomerNode class represents a node in the customer queue, containing a reference to a customer and the next node.
