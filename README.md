# Data Structures Project (Java)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation and usage of various fundamental data structures in Java.

The goal is to showcase the core concepts of each data structure, their applications, and how they are implemented using Java!

The project includes the following data structures:

- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Linked List**
- **Arrays**

This project aims to help anyone learning data structures and algorithms by providing practical implementations in Java.

## How They Work

- **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure that allows adding and removing elements from the same end (top).
- **Queue**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.
- **Linked List**: A linear collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Arrays**: A fixed-size collection of elements, all of the same type, providing constant-time access to elements by index.
